        <p>Hello there, My name is Benjamin Clark, and I am a senior at the University of Missouri! <br>
        I am looking forward to my career in Information Technology and cannot wait to work. <br>
        Over the past 3 years, I have learned essential skills within back-end programming and front-end programming, <br>
        coupled with experience in cyber security and project management. <br>
        During this time, I have stumbled upon a greater understanding of programming languages and database structures. <br>
        Whether it is in Python, HTML or C#, I am always up for the challenge! <br>
        While I haven't learned those skills from an internship quite yet, <br>
        I have learned from my professors and peers, propelling me toward success. <br>
        Beyond my time with academics, I am a massive sports fan! <br>
        Whether it be cheering for Mizzou on the field on Saturdays or cheering alongside Red Kingdom for a Kansas City Chiefs win, <br>
        my passion for them is deep.</p>
