    Hello there, My name is Benjamin Clark, and I am a senior at the University of Missouri! I am looking forward to my career in Information Technology and cannot wait to work. Over the past 3 years, I have learned essential skills within back-end programming and front-end programming, coupled with experience in cyber security and project management. During this time, I have stumbled upon a greater understanding of programming languages and database structures. Whether it is in Python, HTML or C#, I am always up for the challenge! While I haven't learned those skills from an internship quite yet, I have learned from my professors and peers, propelling me toward success. Beyond my time with academics, I am a massive sports fan! Whether it be cheering for Mizzou on the field on Saturdays or cheering alongside Red Kingdom for a Kansas City Chiefs win, my passion for them is deep.
