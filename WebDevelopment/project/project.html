            <p>One of the projects that I have done recently on my own was an iOS app that I made for
                Formula 1. I'm huge into the racing series so I wanted to incorporate that into an app that I
                could make for my iPhone. I had a JSON that had all the information on it like Drivers' standings,
                wins, laps led, and such like that. For the user using it you were able to choose the driver that
                you wanted to learn about and once chosen you were able to see all the data. Eventually, I want
                to add a second part where you can choose the circuit that you want to learn more info about,
                and it will show you its location on Apple Maps as well as info about it.</p>

            <p>The project that me and my group are currently about to start working on for my senior project
                is a Picture-capturing Birdfeeder. The overall purpose of this project is to see as a group what
                we all can accomplish and present it to our professors. As a group, we will be making an open-
                source design so that anyone can replicate it making it the affordable option for the market. The
                bird feeder is going to be composed of a motion sensor that will trigger the camera to take a
                picture of the bird that is landing to get food. The picture will be taken, processed, and sent off
                to a database via a Raspberry Pi that we are programming. The database will be hosted
                elsewhere, and to make the information available, we are making a user-friendly website so that
                you will be able to access and see what just came by! While this is still in the making, we are still
                waiting for approval.</p>

            <p>This group project involved creating a ticketing system for plane and bus reservations. Developed using JavaScript, the program integrates HTML to form the webpage interface. Hosted locally, the application employs Docker for the database backend. This endeavor served as a significant challenge for my JavaScript coding abilities, as I had limited prior experience with the language. However, through perseverance and dedication, I emerged from the project with heightened proficiency and self-assurance in my coding skills.</p>
