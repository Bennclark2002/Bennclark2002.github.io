            <p class="first-letter">O</p>
            <p>Over my career here at the University of Missouri, I have found immense satisfaction in the diverse range of skill sets that I have acquired. My pursuits in Media Technology and Design as well as Web and Mobile Application Development, have provided key information and understanding of multimedia, animation, virtual environments, and application development. These past experiences have not only equipped me with an understanding and proficiency in languages like C#, Python, HTML5, Java, and Swift UI but also fostered my creativity and what I want to do in this world.</p>
            <p>Having the past 4 years of experience working in and outside of class I have come to an understanding of what I want to do with this skill set. Now I want to do anything to get myself into the world of Information Technology. One specific job and or area that has stood out to me is Cyber Security. Cyber Security is an area that I am particularly interested in. It was one of the main reasons that made me switch to Information Technology and if I can get a job practicing it, it would be a dream come true. I want to practice more cyber activities so that I can be in the right place for the workplace.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been involved around campus. I am currently a member of Sigma Phi Delta Professional Engineering Fraternity, and it has been instrumental in shaping my leadership skills and interpersonal skills. Over my time in the fraternity, I have held multiple positions ranging from Executive Board to Judicial Board as well as New Member Board. Experiencing managing a substantial budget, planning external events, and fostering a sense of accountability within has taught me the importance of effective communication, teamwork, and responsibility. Beyond my job within the fraternity, community engagement has been a cornerstone of my development. From participating in Habitat for Humanity to contributing to cleaning up local roads and areas and packaging food at the local food bank, I understand the value of giving back and contributing to society. These experiences have not only enriched my understanding of others' lives but also the way that we can make an impact on not only each other but the world.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, overall, my journey has taken me to media design, application development, and community involvement and has shaped me into a well-rounded individual ready to make his mark on the world. I have a strong commitment to communication, excellence, confidence, collaboration, and social responsibility. I am always dedicated to making a positive impact on the world by applying my skills and knowledge to create a better, technologically advanced future.</p>
